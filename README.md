Here's a full `README.md` content for your Flask ML Web App, including an explanation of the `Procfile` and why it's important:

## 🏡 Boston House Price Prediction App

This is a Flask-based machine learning web application that predicts Boston house prices using a trained regression model. Users can interact via a web UI or API (Postman) to get predictions.

### ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Flask
- Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
- Gunicorn (for production)

Install dependencies locally with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 🚀 How to Run Locally

```bash
python app.py
```

Then go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser.

### 🌐 API Endpoint (for Postman or external clients)

**POST** `/predict_api`  
**Content-Type:** `application/json`

Example JSON:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "OverallQual": 8,
    "GrLivArea": 1500,
    "GarageCars": 2,
    "TotalBsmtSF": 800,
    "FullBath": 2,
    "YearBuilt": 2005,
    "YearRemodAdd": 2010,
    "1stFlrSF": 1100,
    "TotRmsAbvGrd": 6,
    "Fireplaces": 1
  }
}
```

Returns predicted price.

### 🔁 What is `Procfile`?

The `Procfile` is **required for hosting on platforms like Railway, Heroku**, etc. It tells the server **how to run your Flask app in production**.

Here’s what it contains:

```txt
web: gunicorn app:app
```

- `web:` tells the platform to start a web server
- `gunicorn` is a Python WSGI HTTP server used for production deployments
- `app:app` means:  
  - first `app` = name of the Python file (`app.py`)  
  - second `app` = Flask object inside `app.py`

So this tells the platform to run:  
```bash
gunicorn app:app
```

Instead of the Flask development server (which is not suitable for production).

### 🛰️ Deployment

#### Option 1: Railway (Recommended for Flask)

1. Push project to GitHub
2. Go to [https://railway.app](https://railway.app)
3. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub"
4. Select repo and deploy 🎉
5. Access live URL provided by Railway

### 🙌 Acknowledgements

- Data: Boston Housing Dataset
- ML Libraries: scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- UI/UX: HTML, CSS, JS (optional improvements)
